Maze Screen Saver for OS X

Very simple Screensaver module that creates, solves and shows a slideshow of large mazes.

Build targets for standalone OS X & iOS versions also provided. Screensaver testing iteration time is too long otherwise!

Mazes are fun!


My original version was written in Javascript, and run in a ScreenSaver Module I had that displayed web pages.
You can see the javascript version in action here: mazie.globbits.co.uk
